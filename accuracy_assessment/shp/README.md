There are two [shapefiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile) in this folder:

1. `srsample` : this shapefile contains the stratified random sample points extracted from the image classification of the year [2016](https://github.com/acoiman/lulc_zamora_1986_2016/tree/master/lulc/results/2016). 
2. `values`: this shapefile is the result of cleaning the ground-truth dataset. Part two of the notebook: *[Collecting ground-truth data using GEE Python API.](https://github.com/acoiman/lulc_zamora_1986_2016/blob/master/accuracy_assessment/notebook/reference_data.ipynb)*
